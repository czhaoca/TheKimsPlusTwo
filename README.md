Project Description
 
Our project is aimed at potential homebuyers, real estate investors, and market enthusiasts in the Vancouver area. Our platform will support the activity of tracking real estate listings and price trends within the Vancouver housing market. We plan to store data on real estate listings including properties' addresses, asking prices, selling prices, number of rooms, square footage, etc. Users will be able to search and filter through these listings based on their preferences, save their favorite properties, receive alerts for price changes, and visualize housing price trends via various charts or graphs. Should time permit, we also hope to incorporate a feature predicting future housing price trends and integrate with a map API for a more interactive user experience.

Task Breakdown 
1. Collect and store real estate listing data.
Set up a MongoDB database for storing listing data.
Use Node.js and Express.js to scrape or consume data from a real estate API.
Schedule regular data updates.
2. Implement user interface for searching and filtering through listings.
Set up a React.js application for the client-side interface.
Implement a listings page with a table or list of properties.
Add search and filter options for users to refine listings.

Prototypes
 
Note: This is a textual platform, and I can't create or share images here. However, I'd suggest sketching out the following:
 
Homepage with a search bar, filter options, and a table or list of properties.
A detailed view page for each property listing, showing all the available information.
A trends page displaying various charts or graphs of housing price trends.
